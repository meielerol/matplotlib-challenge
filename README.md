## Background

In an animal study using 249 mice with SCC tumor growths the mice were treated with a variety of different drug regimens. Over 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has asked for a top level summary fo the study results which should consist of all tables adn figures needed for a techincal report.

## Data

- Check for duplicated data by 'Mouse ID' and 'Timepoints'. Remove any data associated with that mouse (exclude them from the study overall).
- Generate a summary of stats table per drug regimen
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Variance
    - Standard Deviation
    - SEM (sum of the error means)
- Generate bar plot displaying the number of total mice per drug regimen
- Generate pie plot displaying the number of female or male mice
- Calculate final tumor volume of each mouse across the four most promising treaments: Capomulin, ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
    - Quartiles
    - IQR
    - Outliers from stats across all tumor volumes of promising treaments
- Generate box and whisker plot of final tumor volume for all four treament regimens
    - Quartiles per regimen
    - IQR per regimen
    - Outliers per regimen & highlight with different color
